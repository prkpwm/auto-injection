# AutoKey: Your Smart Autofill and Text Replacement Companion

---

AutoKey is a powerful Chrome extension designed to **streamline your online experience** by automatically filling in form fields and replacing text on webpages. Say goodbye to repetitive typing and hello to efficiency!

## What is AutoKey?

AutoKey is a browser extension that intelligently detects specific patterns in webpage URLs and, based on pre-defined configurations, **injects custom data** into input fields or replaces existing text. This means you can have your usernames, passwords, phone numbers, or any other frequently used text automatically filled in when you visit certain websites.

## How Does AutoKey Work?

AutoKey operates through a simple, yet robust, mechanism:

1.  **URL Pattern Matching**: You define specific URL patterns (e.g., `http://localhost:4300/selling-device/*`) that AutoKey should monitor.
2.  **Configuration Storage**: For each URL pattern, you set up a list of key-value pairs. The "key" represents the placeholder text or attribute name found in a form field (like "USERNAME" or "ระบุเบอร์โทรศัพท์"), and the "value" is the text you want to inject.
3.  **Automatic Injection**: When you visit a webpage that matches one of your configured URL patterns, AutoKey automatically scans the page for input fields or text nodes that contain your defined "keys" and fills them with the corresponding "values."
